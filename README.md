# ArduinoDoorLock
I made this project at BostonHacks in 2016 with Isabella Kuhl. We were awarded the best use of Twilio API. 

The user enters a 4-digit passcode. Once the passcode is entered, the lock either opens or blinks red. If the passcode that is entered is incorrect, then a messege is sent to the owner's phone infomring that someone is trying to enter the house.
